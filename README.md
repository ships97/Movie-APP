# Movie-APP
I tried to create movie app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is a slideshow on the home page of movie app. And in slideshow you can see latest movie suggestions.
There is also a Signup and Login page as well. You can signin with fill your all details and login with the help of your email & password which you entered on the signup 
page. And one more functionality i have given, if you entered your wrong credentials on login page so it gives you a message to re-enter correct details and if you entered
correct credentials on login page so it will be redirected on home page. Netlify link: https://lovely-valkyrie-176100.netlify.app
